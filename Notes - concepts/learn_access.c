 * This program demonstrates using access(2) to check file permissions.
 * - access() checks if the current process can read "example.txt".
 * - R_OK is used as the mode argument to check for read permission.
 * - If access() returns -1, the process does not have the specified permission.
 * - Otherwise, the process has the permission to read the file.

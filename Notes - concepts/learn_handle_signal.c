/*
 * This program demonstrates custom signal handling in C.
 * - SIGTSTP (usually triggered by Ctrl+Z) can have its default behavior (which is to pause a program)
 *   overridden by a custom handler. In this program, we set up such a handler that prevents the program
 *   from being paused, instead printing a message that stopping is not allowed.
 * - SIGCONT, on the other hand, cannot have its default behavior of resuming a program overridden;
 *   additional behaviors can be added, but the continuation of the program cannot be stopped.
 * - SIGURS1: User-defined signal 1 is typically used for custom purposes in programs. It can be
 *   caught and handled, or ignored. This program could implement a custom handler for SIGURS1 to
 *   perform specific tasks or signal internal events.
 * - SIGURS2: User-defined signal 2 is similar to SIGURS1 and is also used for custom, application-defined purposes.
 *   It provides an additional signal option that can be used when more than one user-defined signal is needed.
 * - The program prompts the user to enter a number, reads it, multiplies it by 5, and prints the result.
 * - The third argument of `sigaction`, when not NULL, points to a `struct sigaction` where the previous
 *   action for the signal is saved. This can be used to restore the old signal action later if needed.
 *   Here, it's set to NULL as we don't intend to restore the old action.
